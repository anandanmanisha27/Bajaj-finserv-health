You will be given a set of bills (invoices) with multiple pages (training data); you need to design and
develop data extraction/summarization models that will ‘extract the line item details from these bills
and also provide ‘individual line item amount’, ‘Sub-total’ and ‘Final Total’ of the bill amounts
extracted (sub-totals will be required only where they exist in the bill). ‘Final Total’
will be sum (of all individual line items in the bills) without double-counting.

Its important to ensure that, you don’t miss out on any line item entries and at the same time don’t
double count any entries. The closer your ‘Total AI extracted amounts’ is equal to the ‘Actual Bill Total’
-the better your accuracy.

### Tools
You are free to use tools and LLM you want to solve this problem.

### Sample Dataset
This has ~15 documents with different complexities and document_type for training

### Postman Collection
You can import the following JSON directly to Postman for ease of understanding the request and response structure, your deployed endpoint should follow it exactly.

### Submission Format
You need to deploy your solution in form of an API endpoint. The Signature of the API is as follows:
Request to Student’s API

POST /extract-bill-data
Content-Type: application/json

        "input_tokens": "integer", // Cumulative Tokens from all LLM calls
        "output_tokens": "integer" // Cumulative Tokens from all LLM calls
    },
    "data": {
        "pagewise_line_items": [
        {
            "page_no": "string",
            "page_type": "Bill Detail | Final Bill | Pharmacy",
            "bill_items": [
            {
                "item_name": "string", // Exactly as mentioned in the bill
                "item_amount": "float", // Net Amount of the item post discounts as mentioned in the bill
                "item_rate": "float", // Exactly as mentioned in the bill
                "item_quantity": "float" // Exactly as mentioned in the bill
            }
            ]
        }
        ],
        "total_item_count": "integer" // Count of items across all pages
    }
    }
Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation will be based on the accuracy of the line item data extraction and the bill totals extraction. You need to submit github repository link to the solution. You need to describe your submission in the README.md file.
